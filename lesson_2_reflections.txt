What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

during initialization a hidden files is created. perhaps within that file are other hidden files. let’s check.Yes, 10 whole subfiles are created in the .git directory. They are full of files and directories themselves.

Apparently the whole archive structure is built during initialization.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think the staging area is different in that it is not actually a set of files, just a list of filenames.

The value is that you can begin checking in parts of a large project
as you go along to keep track of what is being added to the commit. This is also logically useful for a team project where everyone takes a piece and adds it to the staging are as they complete their task. The manager can then send a commit and compile everything to see if it works. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

idk

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

if i was working on two different logical changes at the same time but I didn’t want to implement them together I could have branches developing each new feature until they worked, and then merge them to gather to see if they conflicted with one another. Also regionalizing, or making variants to run on multiple platforms could use branching. Of course, having multiple developers on a team would also use branches to separate their work and then merge it together to see if it works as a whole. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

well they give you a tool, but the whole branch strutter amy be better seen with a gui. I would prefer the GUI. but at lest at this point I understand some of the underlying issues with a GUI. Also I don’t know if a GUI can allow unnamed branches or detached heads. I also still haven’t been able to see the branching diagrams in my system like int he examples.
