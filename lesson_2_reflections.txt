What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

during initialization a hidden files is created. perhaps within that file are other hidden files. letâ€™s check.Yes, 10 whole subfiles are created in the .git directory. They are full of files and directories themselves.

Apparently the whole archive structure is built during initialization.
