What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

during initialization a hidden files is created. perhaps within that file are other hidden files. letâ€™s check.Yes, 10 whole subfiles are created in the .git directory. They are full of files and directories themselves.

Apparently the whole archive structure is built during initialization.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think the staging area is different in that it is not actually a set of files, just a list of filenames.

The value is that you can begin checking in parts of a large project
as you go along to keep track of what is being added to the commit. This is also logically useful for a team project where everyone takes a piece and adds it to the staging are as they complete their task. The manager can then send a commit and compile everything to see if it works.
