1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I can think of a few reasons: a) I want to have a "safe" place in the cloud to store my work; b) I want to share with collaborators and use the GitHub repository as our central place to keep work; c) I want to find collaborators by posting my project on GitHub and promote it there; d) I am very mobile and am working on the project from various computers ata various times.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would worry that there might be changes going on at the GitHub repository that I am not making and that the pull operation might overwrite my current work, or might bury my current commit under other developersâ€™ commits. I am not quite sure what would happen.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches exist within the project you are working on. Clones are copies of the whole project. Forks are like branches of clones; a fork is a branch of an entire project, a clone, but a clone that is able to become a separate direction for a project, not to ever merge back into the original from which it was forked.
